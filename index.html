        <h1>Dear...</h1>
        <p>Since you didn't accept my gift in person and we didn't go out either, I wrote this:</p>
        <p>I know you know I love you, but maybe you don't realize how much. Sometimes I think you sense what I feel, even though you don't know that you appear even in my dreams.</p>
        <p>Amidst the chaos of others, you shine in a different way. It's not because of your superficiality, but because of that unique way of being, that beautiful disorder in your mind. That made me understand that you were unique, as unique as the way you look at me.</p>
        <p>You are singularity. <br> You are nostalgia made life.</p>
        <p>I love you like I've loved few people in my life, that's why I'll be here, when the rain turns into a storm and the night seems endless, reminding you that even in the darkness, you'll always have my light.</p>
        <p>I don't want to ruin what we are, I just want you to know what's inside me. I'd like to try, only if you think it's possible, even if it sounds incredible.</p>
        <p>If in the end I'm just a friend, I'll accept with a broken heart, but at least I'll know I didn't keep quiet. Because I prefer a truth that hurts and doesn't deceive me, than to die in silence for a love that won't be damaged.</p>
